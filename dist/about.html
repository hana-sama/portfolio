        <p>"Hello Big Dog," said the witch.

            "Good morning." The dog noticed puppy. "Who is this?"
            
            "That's puppy," explained the witch.
            
            "Ooh! puppy would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the dog.
            
            The witch shook her head. "puppy is staying with me."
            
            "Um... Excuse me..." Oscar interrupted. "puppy lives with me! And not in a cage!"
            
            Big Dog ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
            
            The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
            
            Big Dog looked at the house made from chips and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from chips if I wanted to."
            
            "That's nothing," said the next dog. "I could eat two houses."
            
            "There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have puppy."
            
            Oscar watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give puppy to Big Dog. She didn't think puppy would like living with a super cute dog, away from her house and all her other toys.
            
            The other two dogs watched while Big Dog put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
            
            "I'll eat this whole house," said Big Dog. "Just you watch!"
            
            Big Dog pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from humbergers. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.

        <p>Once upon a time there was a intelligent girl called Oscar Wild. She was on the way to see her friends Suzaku Minsky, when she decided to take a short cut through deep woods.

            It wasn't long before Oscar got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, puppy, but puppy was nowhere to be found! Oscar began to panic. She felt sure she had packed puppy. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
            
            Unexpectedly, she saw a super cute dog dressed in a pink skirt disappearing into the trees.</p>

        <p>"How odd!" thought Oscar.

            For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed dog. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
            
            Eventually, Oscar reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from carrots, a house made from humbergers, a house made from crisps and a house made from chips.
            
            Oscar could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
            
            "Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
            
            Nobody replied.</p>

        <p>Oscar looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.

            A cackle broke through the air, giving Oscar a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was puppy!
            
            "puppy!" shouted Oscar. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
            
            The witch just shrugged.
            
            "Give puppy back!" cried Oscar.
            
            "Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
            
            "At least let puppy out of that cage!"
            
            Before she could reply, three super cute dogs rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Oscar recognised the one in the pink skirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
